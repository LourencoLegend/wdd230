      <p>The State of Sao Paulo accounts for more than 50% of Brazilian finance companies, has the 4th largest stock exchange in the world (BM&F), 50% of oil and gas supply companies, the third largest airplane producer in the world and important research in producing green energy from biomass and solar energy. This is one of the most important centres in the world for bio-fuel development</p>

      <p>The metropolis of São Paulo with its endless skyline is also known as the New York of the southern hemisphere. The city may seem chaotic, but it offers its inhabitants enough tempting alternatives to the missing beach fun. On the Pôr-do-Sol square in the Alto de Pinheiros region, people from all over the city gather to enjoy the sunset. Many consider the square the point with the best view. This is certainly also because there are fewer buildings and the landscape is beautiful.</p>
      <h2>Ibirapuera Park - Sao Paulo, Brazil</h2>

      <p>Sampa has an answer to Central Park, Ibirapuera Park serves as a major recreational site and is one of the main tourist attractions in Sao Paulo. It has paths for walking and jogging, bikeways, woods, lakes, sport courts and areas for relaxation that attract city residents of all ages. Bicycles can be rented also. There are several buildings and sculptures here of note including several museums and churches, along with a large obelisk commemorating the revolution, and a statue of Pedro Alvares Cabral. The entire park overlooks a lovely pond. Admission to the park is free, except when it comes to special events.</p>
      <h2>Mercado Municipal - Sao Paulo, Brazil</h2>

      <p>This market building sits along the Tamanduateí river, and is a beautiful domed art deco building with seventy two stained glass windows created by the same Russian glass artist who created the Sao Paulo Cathedral. Inside is an enjoyable market specializing in fresh food and dried goods. It is also a great place to sample a couple of classic Sampa delights: mortadella sandwiches and pasteis, pockets of dough stuffed with meat, cheese or fish and then fried.</p>

      <p>Summertime in Brazil is from December through March, and winter is June through September but the further north you go, the higher the temperature and the humidity. In fact, the Northeast is too hot to have a winter. Overall, the months of September and October are the best time to vacation in Brazil, as you will avoid the major holiday periods as well as the chilly southern winter and the rainy season in the Pantanal. However, the regions that you are visiting will dictate the best time to go to Brazil.</p>

                <p>
                    This law basically states that the faster the movement of your mouse and the<br>
                    smaller the target the more of a chance there is to be an error or wrongly<br>
                     clicking. However, the bigger the target and the shorted the distance the more accurate you will be.

                <p>This is directed to a site about photography. However, I found through my research that<br>
                the same principles can be appled to a webpage as well.<br>
                To briefily explain what The rule of three is simply put. Deviding up your images with two horizontal<br>
                and two vertical lines to better place the object you a capturing to make it more asthetically pleasing.</p>

                <p> This website I found teaches some great tips on visual Hierarchy.<br> 
                    They have done a great job organizing the content, and displaying in a very pleasant way.

                <img src="images/placeholder-image.png" data-src="images/bridal_veil_falls.jpg" alt="bridal_veil_falls">
                <p>Bridal Veil Falls is a 600-foot-tall waterfall nestled in the southern end of Provo Canyon. Easily reached by car, the mulch-tiered falls are visible from US Route 189. The falls have a rich history due to their association with an aerial tramway that was constructed in 1961. The tram was once lauded as the "world's steepest tramway," but an avalanche destroyed the machinery in 1996.</p>
